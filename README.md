This code will help understand clustering process in Machine Learning. This is an Unsupervised problem. Unsupervised means the dataset will not have any Target Feature.

Two types of Clustering Methods - K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

Preprocessing on Data set has been done on the one loaded from SKLEARN built-in Dataset for IRIS. As we are working on Unsupervised Dataset, we will not be loading the Target column fro the IRIS Dataset.

Dataset had initially 150 Rows. On inspecting 1 Duplicate Row was detected and then removed from it making it 149 rows.

Then Standard Scaler is used to Normalize the dataset

Dimensionality Reduction has been done on cleaned dataset to make it 2 featured dataset for plotting purpose

Then K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering has been perfomed on this.
